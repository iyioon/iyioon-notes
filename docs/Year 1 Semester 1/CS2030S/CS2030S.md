# CS2030s Programing Methodology II

---

> [NUS MODS](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2030S/programming-methodology-ii) [Homepage](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~CS2030S/index.html) [Canvas](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/24642/modules)
This module is a follow up to CS1010. It explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming. Through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object-oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms. Topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.
