## Basics

> [PDF](CS2040_22.DynamicProgrammingIntro.pdf%5C) Optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions to smaller sub-problems


**Overlapping sub-problems:** The same smaller problem is used to solve multiple different bigger problems.

## Longest Increasing Subsequence

> [](CS2040_22.DynamicProgrammingIntro.pdf#page=20)

**Problem:**. You are give an sequence of integers. Your goal is to find the increasing subsequence of maximum length.

### DAG Solution

> One way to find such maximum length is with [](17.Graphs.md#Directed%20Acyclic%20Graphs%5C|DAG). 

For each nodes, draw a directed array to any other nodes with greater value.

**STEP 1:** Topological sort
**STEP 2:**  Calculate longest path - DAG_SSSP. LIS = max(LP)+1
**Performance:** Longest path takes $O(V+E)=O(n^2)$ , Run longest path $n$ times $O(n^3)$

This is inefficient. We don't have to run it n times because to find the maximum path for a node, the maximum path for other connected node have to be solved. This is a example of a overlapping subproblems.

### Using a bottom up approach

Start with the smallest sub-problem:

Move to the next node and examine all outgoing edges and find the maximum. Its largest path will be 1 +  the maximum of the outgoing edge:

Continue for all nodes:

Performance: $O(n^2)$

### Dynamic Programming Recipe

In summary the dynamic programming recipe consist of the following steps:

- **Step 1:** Identify optimal substructure
	- E.g, LIS can be built from suffix LIS
- **Step 2:** Define sub-problems
	- E.g., $S[i]=\operatorname{LIS}(A[i . . n])$ starting at $A[i]$
- **Step 3:** Solve problem using sub-problems
	- E.g., $S[i]=\left(\max _{(i, j) \in E} S[j]\right)+1$
- **Step 4:** Write (pseudo)code
	- E.g. [](CS2040_22.DynamicProgrammingIntro.pdf#page=46%7CCode)
