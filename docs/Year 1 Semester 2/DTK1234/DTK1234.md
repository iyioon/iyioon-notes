# DTK1234
---
>[!info] [NUS MODS](https://nusmods.com/modules/DTK1234/design-thinking) [Canvas](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/36576) 
In this module, students use design principles to develop their creative potential and practise design thinking using a people-centered approach to solve problems and create new possibilities. Through practical activities, students will discover tools and mindsets that guide them in navigating ambiguity in a creative process, observing and learning from others in unfamiliar contexts, and generating and experimenting with ideas quickly. While students draw on design thinking as a personal creative skillset, they will also value the impact of design that affords people the opportunity and privilege to shape the world that they, and others, inhabit.
