## Gray and Sivots

To turn gray into sivot, multiply gray by 20 or 1 depending on alpha or gamma/beta. Then multiply the weighting factor such as on skin.

## Equivalent dose and Effective dose

Effective does have to multiply the weighting factor for a body part. Equvalent does just multiply with weighting factor such as alpha = 20.
## Deterministic effect and Stochastic effect

The severity of stochastic effects are not does related. Due to random and change, without threshold. Probability increase as dose increase

Deterministic effect only occurs after a threshold does. The severity increases with increasing dose. Severity increase as dose increase

## Type of study 

By definition, **epidemiology** is the study (scientific, systematic, and data-driven) of the distribution (frequency, pattern) and determinants (causes, risk factors) of health-related states and events (not just diseases) in specified populations

## Applications of Radiation in Industries

**Level gauges:** Measuring liquid levels

**Density Gauges** Measure the density of the inner structure or contents

**Thickness Gauge** Measure the thickness. Producing sheet materials

**Plant Diagnostics* 

**Industrial radiography** is another method of non-destructive testing using either $\mathrm{x}$-rays or gamma-rays where many types of manufactured components can be examined to verify the internal structure and integrity of the specimen. iridium-192 is used
