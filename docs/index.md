# Welcome to Archive

This is my digital garden where I archive everything I learn during my time in NUS.

My computer science journey:

- [Year 1 Semester 1](Year%201%20Semester%201/Year%201%20Semester%201.md)
- [Year 1 Semester 2](Year%201%20Semester%202/Year%201%20Semester%202.md)

## Before you adventure
