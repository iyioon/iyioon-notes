# Welcome to Archive

This is my digital garden where I archive everything I learn during my time in NUS. Files are organized by semesters:

## Before you adventure

Please note that this website was generated by converting Obsidian markdown files into [Obsidian-MkDocs style](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs), which means that some styles may not be accurate or visually consistent; for any files that are not viewable on the website (e.g `.java`), please feel free to check out my [Github page](https://github.com/iyioon/iyioon-notes/tree/main/docs) and post problems/improvements.

> [!warning] Notice
> Due to GitHub's file size limit, it is not possible to upload every files. I am currently working on migrating the site to a dedicated server.

**Notes file structure**

I organize my notes by creating a dedicated folder for each module, ensuring a streamlined and easily navigable structure. Within each module folder, I establish a main page that contains essential module information and is divided into two primary sections: Resources and My Notes. The Resources section compiles all the relevant reference materials, while the My Notes section houses my personal insights and summaries. When crafting my notes, I begin with a [call-out](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/) section with a link to the resources used, ensuring traceability and ease of access. My approach to note-taking emphasizes long-term utility, as I strive to create comprehensive guides that remain understandable and useful even after an extended period of time.
